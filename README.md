# 2FA-Demo
This program sends a 6-digit code (via email for now, though I might add SMS later) to the userâ€™s inputted email address. It's a very basic program since most of the heavy lifting for generating the OTP is handled by a library, but I thought it was a cool idea, so I decided to make it.

In the future, I could expand this into a larger program with a user base, but for now, it remains a simple demonstration of 2FA/OTP functionality. I plan to gradually add more security features, as the primary goal of this project is to explore the security measures used in real-world applications.
