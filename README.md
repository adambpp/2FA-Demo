# 2FA-Demo
This program just sends out a 6-digit code (e-mail for now, might add sms later) to the users inputted email. Very basic program since all the hard work for the OTP is from a library, but it seemed cool so I wanted to make it. I could always turn this into a bigger program with a userbase later but for now it remains a simple demo of 2FA/OTP.
